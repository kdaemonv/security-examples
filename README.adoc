The goal of this repo is to get everyone on the same page with level of knowledge.

If you know something, share it!

You don't need to be in the EG to contribute.  Helping raise awareness and educate are critical tasks.

This repo is dedicated to spreading that knowledge and getting us all on the same page.  No assumed knowledge required.

The more we collect samples of existing capabilities the better our odds of success.  We can take the good parts, leave the rest and drive commonality across the platform.
